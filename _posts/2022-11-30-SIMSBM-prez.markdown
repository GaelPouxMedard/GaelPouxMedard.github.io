Last years have seen a regain of interest for the use of stochastic block modeling (SBM) in recommender systems.
These models are seen as a flexible alternative to tensor decomposition
techniques that are able to handle labeled data. Recent works proposed to tackle discrete
recommendation problems via SBMs by considering larger contexts as input data and by adding
second order interactions between contexts' related elements. In this work, we show that
these models are all special cases of a single global framework: the Serialized Interacting
Mixed membership Stochastic Block Model (SIMSBM). It allows to model an arbitrarily large
context as well as an arbitrarily high order of interactions.
We demonstrate that SIMSBM generalizes several recent SBM-based baselines.
Besides, we demonstrate that our formulation allows for an increased predictive power on six real-world datasets.
