The identification of which nodes are optimal seeds for spreading processes on a network is a nontrivial
problem that has attracted much interest recently. While activity has mostly focused on the nonrecurrent type of
dynamics, here we consider the problem for the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) spreading model, where
an outbreak seeded in one node can originate an infinite activity avalanche. We apply the theoretical framework
for avalanches on networks proposed by D. B. Larremore et al. [Phys. Rev. E 85, 066131 (2012)] to obtain
detailed quantitative predictions for the spreading influence of individual nodes (in terms of avalanche duration
and avalanche size) both above and below the epidemic threshold. When the approach is complemented with an
annealed network approximation, we obtain fully analytical expressions for the observables of interest close to
the transition, highlighting the role of degree centrality. A comparison of these results with numerical simulations
performed on synthetic networks with power-law degree distribution reveals, in general, good agreement in the
subcritical regime, leaving thus some questions open for further investigation relative to the supercritical region
