Large quantities of data flow on the internet.
When a user decides to help the spread of a piece of information (by
retweeting, liking, posting content), most research works assumes
she does so according to information's content, publication date,
the user's position in the network, the platform used, etc. However,
there is another aspect that has received little attention in the
literature: the information interaction. The idea is that a user's
choice is partly conditioned  by the previous pieces of information
she has been exposed to.
In this document, we review the works done on interaction modeling
and underline several aspects of interactions that complicate their
study. Then, we present an approach seemingly fit to answer those
challenges and detail a dedicated interaction model based on it.
We show our approach fits the problem better than existing methods,
and present leads for future works. Throughout the text,
we show that taking interactions into account improves our
comprehension of information interaction processes in real-world
datasets, and argue that this aspect of information spread is
should not be neglected when modeling spreading processes.
