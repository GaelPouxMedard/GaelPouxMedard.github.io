fig-caption: When playing a game, we (usually) have a plan in mind, a strategy. We show that these complex strategies can be broken down into more elementary, simpler ones. We, humans, use each of those common building blocks to a certain extent (represented here by a color code) to elaborate our own, specific way of playing games.
 Here, each line is a human, and each of the 4 column is a strategy, grouped by complexity.

Many studies have shown that there are regularities in the way human beings make decisions. 
However, our ability to obtain models that capture such regularities and can accurately 
predict unobserved decisions is still limited. We tackle this problem in the context of 
individuals who are given information relative to the evolution of market prices and 
asked to guess the direction of the market. We use a networks inference approach with 
stochastic block models (SBM) to find the  model and network representation that is most 
predictive of unobserved decisions. Our results suggest that users mostly use recent 
information (about the market and about their previous decisions) to guess. Furthermore, 
the analysis of SBM groups reveals a set of strategies used by players to process information 
and make decisions that is analogous to behaviors observed in other contexts.
Our study provides and example on how to quantitatively explore human behavior strategies by 
representing decisions as networks and using rigorous inference and model-selection approaches.
