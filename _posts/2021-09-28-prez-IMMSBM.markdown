Presentation of the paper at RecSys'21, in Amsterdam.

In most real-world applications, it is seldom the case that a result appears 
independently from an environment. In social networks, users’ behavior results 
from the people they interact with, news in their feed, or trending topics. 
In natural language, the meaning of phrases emerges from the combination of words. 
In general medicine, a diagnosis is established on the basis of the interaction of 
symptoms. Here, we propose the Interacting Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model 
(IMMSBM), which investigates the role of interactions between entities 
(hashtags, words, memes, etc.) and quantifies their importance within the aforementioned 
corpora. We find that in inference tasks, taking them into account leads to average 
relative changes with respect to non-interacting models of up to 150\% in the 
probability of an outcome and greatly improves the predictions performances. 
Furthermore, their role greatly improves the predictive power of the model. Our 
findings suggest that neglecting interactions when modeling real-world phenomena 
might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn.
