Most models of information diffusion online rely on the assumption that pieces of information 
spread independently from each other. However, several works pointed out the necessity of 
investigating the role of interactions in real-world processes, and highlighted possible 
difficulties in doing so: interactions are sparse and brief. As an answer, recent advances 
developed models to account for interactions in underlying publication dynamics. In this 
article, we propose to extend and apply one such model to determine whether interactions 
between news headlines on Reddit play a significant role in their underlying publication 
mechanisms. After conducting an in-depth case study on 100,000 news headline from 2019, 
we retrieve state-of-the-art conclusions about interactions and conclude that they play 
a minor role in this dataset.
