Gaël Poux-Médard (Paris, 1996) obtained a literary baccalaureate in 2014 in Strasbourg (France), 
and immediately switched to learning 
physics at the **University Lyon 1 (France)**. After finishing his physics bachelor in 2017, he 
integrated the **Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) of Lyon**. During his M.Sc degree "Physics of complex systems", 
he completed two internships in machine learning: in **Università Rovira i Virgilli (Tarragona, Spain)** 
for 3 months, and at the **Istituto dei Sistemi Complessi or CNR-ISC (Rome, Italy)** for 6 months. 
Both internships eventually led to publish in great journals. 
In parallel, he started and obtained a M.Sc diploma in Digital Humanities at the ENS of Lyon. 
Both M.Sc degrees were obtained in 2019. Finally, he started a PhD thesis in October 2019 at the
**University Lyon 2**.

Writing this short resume, I hope I managed to emphasise two of my most defining traits: 
flexibility and curiosity. I switched from a literary baccalaureate to a physics B.Sc 
in order to explore natural sciences, because I was interested in it. It took me one 
month to catch up with a 2 years program, and I finished in the top 5% of my university.
I did a similar leap when I started applied mathematics and computer science, first at the ENS, 
then within a PhD. This transition implied to learn about a whole new field I had 
little few explored before, and led to international publications within the following year.
Finally, I cumulated a Digital Humanities degree to broaden my horizon of computational
social sciences applications.
My motivation has not changed since, and is about exploring how mathematical sciences 
can help social sciences. The idea is to bridge the gap between researchers in the field and 
the enormous amount of data they possess yet did not extensively explore.
