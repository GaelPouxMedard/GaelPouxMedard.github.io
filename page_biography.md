I (Gaël Poux-Médard, 1996) obtained a literary baccalaureate in 2014 in Strasbourg (France), 
and immediately switched to learning 
physics at the **University Lyon 1** (France). After finishing my physics bachelor in 2017, I 
integrated the Ecole Normale Supérieure or **ENS de Lyon**. During my M.Sc degree "Physics of complex systems", 
I completed two internships in machine learning: in **SEES:lab, Università Rovira i Virgilli** (Tarragona, Spain) 
for 3 months, and at the Istituto dei Sistemi Complessi or **CNR-ISC** (Rome, Italy) for 6 months. 
In parallel, I obtained a M.Sc degree in Digital Humanities at the ENS of Lyon. 
Both M.Sc degrees were obtained in 2019. Finally, I defended on September 2022 a PhD thesis I started in October 2019 
at the **Université de Lyon** (Université Lumière Lyon II).
I am currently as a post-doctoral scientist jointly employed by the World Health Organization's (**WHO**) International 
Agency for Research against Cancer (**IARC**) and by the University Lyon 1 (**UCBL**).
